Uhh this mod basically lets you change the items and blocks that only appear in certian types of worlds.
For example, You have a corrupt world and want some crimson loot
For example, You have a copper world but, some mod forgot to add a copper recipe and added only a tin recipe instead.
Or, you have a pink dungeon, but really want blue dungeon bricks (i dunno maybe you like building)

I made this because I wanted mythril on my world which was orichalcum, and decided to include other things

The full list of item swap thingies is on the homepage in the terraria forums.
